    "description": "The Well License Condition subset is necessarily abstract, because it is not possible to explicitly capture every kind of condition that may be imposed on a license by an authority, a partner or other stakeholder.  Conditions may be simple or complex, and are usually triggered by date or activity.  They also may specify requirements for how and when they must be completed.  License conditions are increasingly more rigorous,  and data submissions are  considered critical elements by most regulators. Some conditions are one time, and others are repeating.  In general, repeating conditions are tracked as obligations.  \n\nConditions often have to do with regulatory compliance, environmental stewardship, reporting operations, providing technical or business data, paying fees or obtaining additional approvals under specific circumstances. \n\nFailure to comply with license conditions can result in fines or other penalties, and license suspension or even revocation.",
