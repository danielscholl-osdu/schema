        "description": "Position uncertainty refers to the radius around a given location that is likely to contain the true value of the measurement with a specified confidence level. The position is defined in three-dimensional space with x, y, and z coordinates. For instance, if the location uncertainty radius is 1.5 meters and the confidence level is 1 sigma (approximately 61% using Rayleigh distribution), it means that the actual location is expected to be within a sphere of 1.5 meters radius from the reported position 61% of the time.",

        "description": "The confidence level, expressed as sigma and using Rayleigh distribution, indicates the degree of certainty that the predicted three-dimensional location is accurate. For example, if the location uncertainty radius is 1.5 meters and the confidence level is 1 sigma, it means that the actual position is expected to fall within a sphere with a radius of 1.5 meters from the reported position 61% of the time. The radius represents the extent of this sphere, defined by the location uncertainty. For a three-dimensional position given in x, y, and z coordinates, the rule of thumb for sigma levels is as follows when using Rayleigh distribution: 1 sigma corresponds to a 61% confidence level, 2 sigma corresponds to a 99% confidence level and 3 sigma corresponds to nearly a 100% confidence level. In comparison, for a one-dimensional case assuming Gaussian distribution, these sigma levels represent: 1 sigma corresponds to a 68% confidence level, 2 sigma corresponds to a 95% confidence level and 3 sigma corresponds to a 99.7% confidence level.",
