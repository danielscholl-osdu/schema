    "description": "SubjectiveClassificationRating is used for the categorization of ratings, degrees or interpretations that are subjective and dependent on context, often employed to convey relative qualities or degrees. The meanings of these classifications can fluctuate depending on the context they are used in and may be founded on personal beliefs, individual viewpoints, or experiences, rather than on objective, quantifiable criteria.\nThese classifications are utilized to categorize ratings based on their intended purpose, which could be quantity/size, quality/desirability, strength/intensity, or confidence/certainty.\nIt\u2019s important to note that these classifications are not designed for use when describing data or interpretations through statistical or data distribution analysis. Furthermore, they are intended to be distinct from data assurance, which strives for a more objective and confident position, typically adhering to standard operating procedures or control and assurance frameworks.",
