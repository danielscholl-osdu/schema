# R2 Open Subsurface Data Universe JSON Schemas

The schemas have been removed as their original definition did
not conform to the Storage service expectations. There was no
Core Schema service available in R2.

The first Storage service compliant schemas are introduced in 
R3. See [../R3-json-schema](../R3-json-schema).
