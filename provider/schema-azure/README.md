## Running Locally

### Requirements

In order to run this service locally, you will need the following:

- [Maven 3.6.0+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [AdoptOpenJDK8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
- Infrastructure dependencies, deployable through the relevant [infrastructure template](https://dev.azure.com/slb-des-ext-collaboration/open-data-ecosystem/_git/infrastructure-templates?path=%2Finfra&version=GBmaster&_a=contents)
- While not a strict dependency, example commands in this document use [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

### General Tips

**Environment Variable Management**
The following tools make environment variable configuration simpler
 - [direnv](https://direnv.net/) - for a shell/terminal environment
 - [EnvFile](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7861-envfile) - for [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

**Lombok**
This project uses [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) for code generation. You may need to configure your IDE to take advantage of this tool.
 - [Intellij configuration](https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij)
 - [VSCode configuration](https://projectlombok.org/setup/vscode)


### Environment Variables

In order to run the service locally, you will need to have the following environment variables defined.

**Note** The following command can be useful to pull secrets from keyvault:
```bash
az keyvault secret show --vault-name $KEY_VAULT_NAME --name $KEY_VAULT_SECRET_NAME --query value -otsv
```

### Configure Maven

Check that maven is installed:
```bash
$ mvn --version
Apache Maven 3.6.0
Maven home: /usr/share/maven
Java version: 1.8.0_212, vendor: AdoptOpenJDK, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/jdk8u212-b04/jre
...
```

You will need to configure access to the remote maven repository that holds the OSDU dependencies. This file should live within `~/.m2/settings.xml`:
```bash
$ cat ~/.m2/settings.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>os-core</id>
            <username>mvn-pat</username>
            <!-- Treat this auth token like a password. Do not share it with anyone, including Microsoft support. -->
            <!-- The generated token expires on or before 11/14/2019 -->
            <password>$PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
```

### Build and run the application

After configuring your environment as specified above, you can follow these steps to build and run the application.
1. Navigate to the root of the schema project, os-schema. For building the project using command line, run below command :
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
    This will build the core project as well as all the underlying projects. If we want  to build projects for specific cloud vendor, we can use mvn --projects command. For example, if we want to build only for Azure, we can use below command :
    ```bash
    mvn --projects schema-core,provider/schema-azure clean install
    ```
2. Run schema service in command line. We need to select which cloud vendor specific schema-service we want to run. For example, if we want to run schema-service for Azure, run the below command : 
    ```bash 
    # Running Azure : 
    java -jar  provider\schema-gcp\target\os-schema-azure-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-spring-boot.jar
3. The port and path for the service endpoint can be configured in ```application.properties``` in the provider folder as following. If not specified, then  the web container (ex. Tomcat) default is used: 
    ```bash
    server.servlet.contextPath=/api/schema-service/v1/
    server.port=8080
    ```


### Test the application

After the service has started it should be accessible via a web browser by visiting [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html). If the request does not fail, you can then run the integration tests.

### Running automated integration tests:
These tests validate functionality of schema service. 

They can then be run/debugged directly in your IDE of choice using the GUI or via the commandline using below command from schema-core project.
Below command has to be run post building complete project.
    

    cd testing/schema-test-core
    mvn verify -DVENDOR=azure -DHOST=http://localhost:8080 -DPRIVATE_TENANT1=opendes -DPRIVATE_TENANT2=tenant2 -DSHARED_TENANT=common -Dcucumber.options="--tags @SchemaService"
    
Below command can be run through azure-pipeline.yml after setting environment variables in the pipeline.

	verify "-Dcucumber.options=--tags @SchemaService"

## Debugging

Jet Brains - the authors of Intellij IDEA, have written an [excellent guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/debugging-your-first-java-application.html) on how to debug java programs.


## Deploying service to Azure

Service deployments into Azure are standardized to make the process the same for all services. The steps to deploy into
Azure can be [found here](https://dev.azure.com/slb-des-ext-collaboration/open-data-ecosystem/_git/infrastructure-templates?path=%2Fdocs%2Fosdu%2FSERVICE_DEPLOYMENTS.md&_a=preview)
