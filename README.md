## Running the schema service locally

The Schema Service is a Maven multi-module project with each cloud implemention placed in its submodule. To build or run Schema Service locally, follow the below steps :

## 1. Google Cloud deployment

Instructions for running the Google Cloud implementation in the cloud can be found [here](./provider/schema-gc/README.md).

## 2. Azure deployment

Instructions for running the Azure implementation in the cloud can be found [here](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform/system/schema-service/-/blob/master/provider/schema-azure/README.md).

## Running Automated Integration Test

DevSanity tests are located in a schema-core project in testing directory under the project root directory.

1. Google Cloud
These tests validate functionality of schema service.

They can then be run/debugged directly in your IDE of choice using the GUI or via the commandline using below command from schema-core project.
Below command has to be run post building complete project.

Instructions for running the Google Cloud integration tests can be found [here](./provider/schema-gc/README.md).

Below command can be run through azure-pipeline.yml after setting environment variables in the pipeline.

## Deploy Shared Schemas

Schema service as part of deployment deploys pre-defined OSDU schemas so end users can get community accepted schemas to refer. Such schemas are present in [folder](./deployments/shared-schemas/osdu) and script to deploy the schema are present [here](deployments/scripts).

Details to deploy shared schemas can be found under [README.md](./deployments/shared-schemas/README.md)
  
## AWS

Instructions for running and testing this service can be found [here](./provider/schema-aws/README.md)  

## Open API 3.0 - Swagger
- Swagger UI : https://host/context-path/swagger (will redirect to https://host/context-path/swagger-ui/index.html)
- api-docs (JSON) : https://host/context-path/api-docs
- api-docs (YAML) : https://host/context-path/api-docs.yaml

All the Swagger and OpenAPI related common properties are managed here [swagger.properties](./schema-core/src/main/resources/swagger.properties)

#### Server Url(full path vs relative path) configuration
- `api.server.fullUrl.enabled=true` It will generate full server url in the OpenAPI swagger
- `api.server.fullUrl.enabled=false` It will generate only the contextPath only
- default value is false (Currently only in Azure it is enabled)
