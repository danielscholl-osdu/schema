Feature: To verify functionality of PUT schema Service

  ### Commons test steps are accomplished here
  Background: Common steps for all tests are executed
    Given I generate user token and set request headers for "TENANT1"
    Given I hit schema service GET List API with "authority" , "SchemaSanityTest" , "true"
    Given I hit schema service POST API with "/input_payloads/postInPrivateScope_positiveScenario.json" and data-partition-id as "TENANT1" only if status is not development

  @SchemaService
  Scenario Outline: Verify that Schema Service's PUT API works correctly without scope field
    Given I hit schema service PUT API with <InputPayload>, data-partition-id as <tenant>
    Then put schema service should respond back with <ReponseStatusCodeForPUT>
    And schema service should respond back with <ReponseStatusCodeForGET> and <ResponseMessageforGET>

    Examples: 
      | parameter   | value              | latestVersion | InputPayload                                               | tenant    | ReponseStatusCode | ResponseMessage                                                    | ReponseStatusCodeForPUT | ReponseStatusCodeForGET | ResponseMessageforGET                  |
      | "authority" | "SchemaSanityTest" | "true"        | "/input_payloads/postInPrivateScope_positiveScenario.json" | "TENANT1" | "201"             | "/output_payloads/SchemaPost_PrivateScope_SuccessfulCreation.json" | "200"                   | "200"                   | "/output_payloads/ResolvedSchema.json" |

  @SchemaService
  Scenario Outline: Verify that Schema Service's PUT API works correctly and update schema properly
    Given I hit schema service PUT API with <InputPayload>, data-partition-id as <tenant>
    And put schema service should respond back with <ReponseStatusCodeForPUT>
    When I hit schema service PUT API with <UpdatedInputPayload>, data-partition-id as <tenant>
    Then put schema service should respond back with <ReponseStatusCodeForPUT>
    And schema service should respond back with <ReponseStatusCodeForGET> and <ResponseMessageforGET>

    Examples: 
      | parameter   | value              | latestVersion | InputPayload                                               | tenant    | ReponseStatusCode | ResponseMessage                                                    | ReponseStatusCodeForPUT | ReponseStatusCodeForGET | ResponseMessageforGET                         | UpdatedInputPayload                                      |
      | "authority" | "SchemaSanityTest" | "true"        | "/input_payloads/postInPrivateScope_positiveScenario.json" | "TENANT1" | "201"             | "/output_payloads/SchemaPost_PrivateScope_SuccessfulCreation.json" | "200"                   | "200"                   | "/output_payloads/UpdatedResolvedSchema.json" | "/input_payloads/putUpdatedSchema_positiveScenario.json" |

  @SchemaService
  Scenario Outline: Verify that Schema Service's PUT API throws error if update is requested for schema which is not in development status.
    Given I hit schema service PUT API with <InputPayload>, data-partition-id as <tenant> and mark schema as <status>.
    When I hit schema service PUT API with <InputPayload>, data-partition-id as <tenant>
    Then service should respond back with error <ReponseStatusCode> and <ResponseMessage>

    Examples: 
      | InputPayload                                               | tenant    | ReponseStatusCode | ResponseMessage                                                       | status      |
      | "/input_payloads/postInPrivateScope_positiveScenario.json" | "TENANT1" | "400"             | "/output_payloads/SchemaPut_InvalidStatusObsoletePublishedError.json" | "OBSOLETE"  |
      | "/input_payloads/postInPrivateScope_positiveScenario.json" | "TENANT1" | "400"             | "/output_payloads/SchemaPut_InvalidStatusObsoletePublishedError.json" | "PUBLISHED" |

  @SchemaService
  Scenario Outline: Verify that Schema Service's PUT API works like POST request when parameter from id is changed
    Given I hit schema service PUT API with <InputPayload>, data-partition-id as <tenant> with next major version
    Then put schema service should respond back with <ReponseStatusCodeForPUT>
    And schema service should respond back with <ReponseStatusCodeForGET> and <ResponseMessageforGET>

    Examples: 
      | parameter   | value              | latestVersion | InputPayload                                               | tenant    | ReponseStatusCode | ResponseMessage                                                    | ReponseStatusCodeForPUT | ReponseStatusCodeForGET | ResponseMessageforGET                  |
