Feature: To verify functionality of POST schema Service

  ### Common test steps are accomplished here
  Background: Common steps for all tests are executed
    Given I generate user token and set request headers for "TENANT1"
    Given I get latest schema with authority, source, entityType as "SchemaSanityTest", "testSource", "testEntity" respectively
    Given I hit schema service POST API with "/input_payloads/Base_Schema.json" and data-partition-id as "TENANT1" only if status is not development

  @SchemaService
  Scenario Outline: Verify that Schema Service's POST API responds successfully even if ID, Title, x-osdu and few other optional attributes are added
    Given I hit schema service POST API with <BaseInputPayload> and data-partition-id as <tenant> and update versions
    Then service should respond back with <ReponseStatusCode> and <ResponseMessage1>
    Given I hit schema service POST API with <InputPayloadWithChanges> and data-partition-id as <tenant> with increased patch version only
    Then user gets response as <ReponseStatusCode> and <ResponseMessage>

    Examples: 
      | BaseInputPayload                   | InputPayloadWithChanges                            | tenant    | ReponseStatusCode | ResponseMessage                                       | ResponseMessage1                                                   |
      | "/input_payloads/Base_Schema.json" | "/input_payloads/Base_Schema_ID.json"              | "TENANT1" | "201"             | "/output_payloads/SchemaPost_SuccessfulCreation.json" | "/output_payloads/SchemaPost_PrivateScope_SuccessfulCreation.json" |
      | "/input_payloads/Base_Schema.json" | "/input_payloads/Base_Schema_Title.json"           | "TENANT1" | "201"             | "/output_payloads/SchemaPost_SuccessfulCreation.json" | "/output_payloads/SchemaPost_PrivateScope_SuccessfulCreation.json" |

  Scenario Outline: Verify that Schema Service's POST API responds as bad request when only patch version is increased and Additional properties attribute has false value
    When I hit schema service POST API with <InputPayloadWithChanges> and data-partition-id as <tenant> with increased patch version only
    Then user gets patch version error response as <ReponseStatusCode> and <ResponseMessage>

    Examples:

  @SchemaService
  Scenario Outline: Verify that Schema Service's POST API responds as bad request when minor and patch versions are increased and Additional properties attribute has false value
    When I hit schema service POST API with <InputPayloadWithChanges> and data-partition-id as <tenant> with increased minor version and patch version
    Then user gets minor version error response as <ReponseStatusCode> and <ResponseMessage>

    Examples:
