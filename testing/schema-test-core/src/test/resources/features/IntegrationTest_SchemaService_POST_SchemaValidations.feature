Feature: To verify schema validation functionality of POST schema Service

  ### Common test steps are accomplished here
  Background: Common steps for all tests are executed
    Given I generate user token and set request headers for "TENANT1"
    Given I get latest schema with authority, source, entityType as "SchemaSanityTest", "testSource", "testEntity" respectively
    Given I hit schema service POST API with "/input_payloads/Base_Schema.json" and data-partition-id as "TENANT1" only if status is not development

  @SchemaService
  Scenario Outline: Verify that Schema Service's POST API responds successfully even if ID, Title, x-osdu and few other optional attributes are added
    Given I hit schema service POST API with <BaseInputPayload> and data-partition-id as <tenant> and update versions
    Then service should respond back with <ReponseStatusCode> and <ResponseMessage1>
    Given I hit schema service POST API with <InputPayloadWithChanges> and data-partition-id as <tenant> with increased patch version only
    Then user gets response as <ReponseStatusCode> and <ResponseMessage>

    Examples: 
      | BaseInputPayload                   | InputPayloadWithChanges                            | tenant    | ReponseStatusCode | ResponseMessage                                       | ResponseMessage1                                                   |
      | "/input_payloads/Base_Schema.json" | "/input_payloads/Base_Schema_ID.json"              | "TENANT1" | "201"             | "/output_payloads/SchemaPost_SuccessfulCreation.json" | "/output_payloads/SchemaPost_PrivateScope_SuccessfulCreation.json" |
      | "/input_payloads/Base_Schema.json" | "/input_payloads/Base_Schema_Title.json"           | "TENANT1" | "201"             | "/output_payloads/SchemaPost_SuccessfulCreation.json" | "/output_payloads/SchemaPost_PrivateScope_SuccessfulCreation.json" |

  Scenario Outline: Verify that Schema Service's POST API responds as bad request when only patch version is increased and Additional properties attribute has false value
    When I hit schema service POST API with <InputPayloadWithChanges> and data-partition-id as <tenant> with increased patch version only
    Then user gets patch version error response as <ReponseStatusCode> and <ResponseMessage>

  Scenario Outline: Verify that Schema Service's POST API responds as bad request when minor and patch versions are increased and Additional properties attribute has false value

    Then user gets minor version error response as <ReponseStatusCode> and <ResponseMessage>
